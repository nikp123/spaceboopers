I mean, this is a relly simple game made as a C++ practice.

But if you want to develop this game further, go ahead. 
You may expect, however, that I don't respond right away becauce
I have other things going on in life.

Try to do the following:
 * tabs for indentation
 * using curly braces on the same line
 * try to keep the class based structure of the code
 * `camelCase` for variables inside of functions/classes and `this_thing` for function arguments
 * also use `camelCase` for function names
 * keep it minimalistic, don't load heavy assets (so far it doesn't load anything)
